Questions: 
What are some ways in which Computer Science can help fight against COVID-19? 

In the article, Bowman and the scientists have created a software which enables them to 
essentially borrow computer power from others. This is defined as a computer science, and without
this technology they would not have been able to study COVIDâ€™s spike proteins since the 
simulations would take up so much computer power. Computer Science has also helped the fight 
against COVID-19 using the skill to create the simulations in real life. 

In your opinion, should people enable access to the resources of their personal computers as tools 
for research? Are there any risks?:


As I started using my personal computer a lot since I came to ISAK, I realized the benefit of doing the research 
using a personal computer. However, at the same time, I sometimes forget the risk that my persnal date might be sold 
without realzing. So, I would like to distribute my computer power in order to help fight against the COVID-19, but 
on the other hand, I also think I have a right to know how the power is being used.
